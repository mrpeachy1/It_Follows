Introduction
It Follows: Snail Edition is a GPS-based horror game for Android. In the game, a slow but relentless snail chases you in real-world space. This policy explains what information the app collects, how it’s used, and your choices about it.

Information We Collect
Location data
The app uses your phone’s location to track your movement during the game.
It runs in the background so the snail can keep moving even if you minimize the app.
The app may continue tracking after your phone restarts until you stop the game or turn off location permissions.
Notifications are sent when the snail is nearby or catches you.

Game progress and settings
The app saves your game progress (coins, items, power-ups, and shop activity) on your device so you don’t lose progress between sessions.
It also saves settings like volume, snail speed, starting distance, and chosen graphics.
If you pause or quit, the game saves your position so you can continue later.

Advertising and diagnostics
The app may show ads, including rewarded ads that give you in-game bonuses if you watch them.
Before showing ads, it asks for your consent through Google’s consent system.
The app also uses Google services (Maps, Ads, Location) and Firebase Crashlytics to track errors, which means Google may collect device and diagnostic information.

How We Use the Information
Location data makes the snail move toward you, updates the map, and triggers warnings when it’s close.
Game progress and settings let you continue where you left off and keep your chosen preferences.
Advertising data makes sure ads only show if you’ve agreed, and diagnostic data helps fix bugs and crashes.

Third-Party Services
The app uses Google services (Maps, Location, Ads, Crashlytics). These services may collect information under Google’s own privacy policies.
Data Storage and Retention
All game data is stored locally on your device.
You can clear your game progress by starting a new game, quitting, or uninstalling the app.
Location tracking stops when you quit the game, stop the service, or turn off location permissions.
Your Choices and Controls
You can turn off location or notification permissions in your phone’s settings.
You can reset your game progress in the app at any time.
You can revisit your ad consent choices through the Google ad settings.

Security
Your saved data is private to the app and can’t be accessed by other apps. Location tracking always runs with a visible notification so you know when it’s active.

Children’s Privacy
This game is meant for players 13 and older. If you believe a child under 13 has used the app and provided data, contact us and we’ll delete the information.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we do, the updated version will show a new effective date.
