    <string name="how_to_play_text">"Run in real life to stay ahead of the snail.\n\n
The snail is always coming — slowly but surely.\n
It follows your GPS location and never stops.\n\n
If it catches you — you die.\n\n
Use power-ups to survive a little longer,\n
but they become less effective as the snail gets faster.\n\n
🧂 Salt Bomb\n
Freezes the snail in place for 15 seconds.\n\n
🐚 Decoy Shell\n
Drops a fake player marker to lure the snail away.\n\n
🛡 Shell Shield\n
Blocks one collision — the snail passes through you.\n\n
📯 Snail Whistle\n
Blow the horn to lure the snail to a random spot up to 2 km away.\n\n
🔀 Snail Swap\n
Instantly trade places with the snail — a risky escape move.\n\n
🧲 Snail Repel\n
Spend coins to push the snail back 50-200 meters, then wait for it to recharge.\n\n
🛍️ Power-ups can be purchased in the shop\n
(look for the snail coin icon on your map).\n\n
But beware... the snail evolves.\n\n
Every few minutes, it may unleash a new behavior:\n
🫥 Vanish\n
The snail disappears from the map temporarily.\n\n
🎭 Fake Snail\n
It spawns a false marker to mislead you.\n\n
⚡ Teleport\n
It jumps forward a short distance without warning.\n\n
🐌 Snail Beacon Event\n
Random beacons appear on the map during the day. Reach one before the snail to push it back 50 meters.\n
If the snail gets there first, its speed doubles for the next 24 hours.\n\n
It’s slow…\n
…but it never, ever stops."</string>
