continuebtn patch
    made the menu open as a non-blocking overlay, or show a message like “⏳ The snail is still hunting you...”
    added continue button to resume the game and close the menu when the player presses back on the phone
    🐌 Continue Functionality Added
    ✅ Main Menu UI:
        Added Continue button and snailWarningText to activity_main_menu.xml.
        Button appears only if a saved game state exists (based on SharedPreferences).
    ✅ Game State Load:
        Checks for keys like snail_lat_before_pause and player_lat_before_pause.
        If found, displays Continue and warning text.
    ✅ Click Behavior:
        Continue passes intent.putExtra("isNewGame", false) to MainActivity.
        💾 Game State Save / Load
    ✅ SharedPreferences Save:
        Saves snail/player positions, power-up counts, time paused, etc.
        ✅ loadGameState():
        Loads:        Snail position       Playr position        Elapsed game time Power-up inventory (saltBomb, shellShield, decoyShell) Ensured it defers displaying player marker until GPS provides fresh data.
        🔥 Startup Logic in MainActivity.java
    🔁 On game start:
        Checks isNewGame intent extra.    If true: Clears saved state, spawns new snail, starts new game.   If false: Loads saved state, resumes game from previous positions, resumes snail chase.   ⛔ Also clears saved state unconditionally later in onCreate — this was flagged for potential removal if restoring a saved game. (Could break Continue logic.)
